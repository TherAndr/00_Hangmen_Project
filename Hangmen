# Hangman game
Hangman is a guessing game where the player(s) try to guess the word by suggesting a letters.  
Player is allowed a certain number of mistakes.  
The game starts with a word where all letters are replaced with a `-` so the only information available to a player is a number of letters in a word.  
**Start**: `------`  
For each correctly guessed letter, a position of the letter is revealed (if there are multiple positions for a same letter, they are all revealed.  
**Correct**: `-E--E-`  
For each wrongly guessed letter, number of allowed mistakes decreases by 1.  
**Wrong**: 'Number of allowed mistakes is now 5'
Name of the game comes from a drawing of a hanged stick figure. For every mistake a new element of a hanged figure is added.  
If a player guesses a word before the last element of a figure is added, a player wins.  
If a player doesn't guess a word before the last element of a figure is added, player loses.
**Here you can see a simulation of 3 different steps:**  
Hidden word is: ------

Pick a letter:  
 S  
Correct! There is a letter S in a secret word!  
S-----

Pick a letter:  
 V  
WRONG! Number of mistakes left: 5
